# AzureOnTheCheap
Azure on the Cheap posts focus on the architecture, techniques and technology in Azure that add considerable value without breaking the bank. This value is being measured in both the amount of effort taken to develop, provision, and maintain the resources, as well as the monthly charge for the resource.

This project is provided to provide a sample project of how the technology highlighted in the posts were put together. It is not meant as a best practice guide but it is encouraged that viewers contribute to the quality of the examples.

If you see the value in this project, then please comment and contribute!
